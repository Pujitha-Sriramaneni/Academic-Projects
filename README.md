The number of people joining different segments of armed forces such as navy, army and air force is huge. All of them co-exist in environment where there are several bodies responsible for giving permissions, seeking permissions, granting the allowances and communicating with other bodies which needs to be organized for smooth functioning so as to avoid miscommunications and time complexities.

Creating an application to cater to the needs and provide facilities to the people working in navy, army, air force. Government is the regulatory body which provides permission to the armed forces in times of emergency and is responsible for budgeting and to provide weapons when there is a shortage of weapons in the respective armed forces.
Not only this, our application also aims at handling the data.
